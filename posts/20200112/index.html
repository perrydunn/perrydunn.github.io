      <p class="summary">Is 2020 off to a flier?</p>
      <h2 class="date">January 9, 2020</h2>

      
    </header>

    <p>It&rsquo;s been a super break but I&rsquo;m ready to go back to work, and tomorrow I start a new job, the first as a software developer &ndash; or is that &ldquo;software engineer&rdquo;?</p>

<p>But before tomorrow arrives I&rsquo;d like to quickly summarise the start of 2020, reviewing the first 12 days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions&rdquo; Ever done those? I haven&rsquo;t. Until now. And by design they&rsquo;re all very selfish, just about improving my quality of life. Perhaps in 2022 &ndash; accounting for expected unexpected delays &ndash; a virtuous, selfless list will be revealed.</p>

<ol>
<li>Caffeine: By the end of the year, coffee will only be for social occasions and limited to 5 per week. There will be no changes in other consumption habits to make up for the shortfall.</li>
<li>Bedtime Mobile: No mobile to be permitted in the bedroom by the end of the year. Use an alarm clock, not the mobile&rsquo;s alarm clock feature.</li>
<li>Cycle to Work: Cycle to and from work at least 3 times per week.</li>
<li>Alcohol: No casual beer/wine at home when it&rsquo;s just the usual crowd (housemates).</li>
</ol>

<p>As for updates on these from the first 12 days:</p>

<ol>
<li>Caffeine: I started this one early, in December, so that by the time I start work tomorrow my body has adjusted to max one coffee per day. It&rsquo;s gone well. 0/1 coffee per day no problem, though I have been drinking more (breakfast/builder&rsquo;s) tea.</li>
<li>Bedtime Mobile: I received an alarm clock for Christmas and I&rsquo;m using it, but I am still taking my mobile into the bedroom even though I have then immediately switched it to flight mode. I&rsquo;d say this is going well, since I have another 11.5 months to crack the habit.</li>
<li>Cycle to Work: Since I&rsquo;m not yet in a job an update is a bit strange here. That said, I have been out on the bike a lot the past fortnight, making use of having been signed up as a Stuart delivery partner (Stuwie) whilst at Stuart. Last week I spent 10 hours on the Stuart platform and made just over £100, which is ok considering I was working without shifts.</li>
<li>Alcohol: This one is going well. I almost cracked the other night as before Christmas I&rsquo;d signed up for Beer52 to make use of a killer offer (10 craft beers for the cost of the delivery only) and these beers are teasing me in the fridge&hellip; I&rsquo;d played tennis both morning and evening and would have loved a cold one. I resisted.</li>
</ol>

<p>What about other stuff? Not the resolution bs.</p>

<p>Films?</p>

<p><strong>Old Release</strong> <em>Cocktail (1988)</em> &ndash; Watch it if you haven&rsquo;t! Super film, fantastic soundtrack, Tom Cruise being Tom Cruise without the Mission Impossible stunt stuff. Perfect for a Sunday evening or any other evening or time of day whenever. Versatile.</p>

<p><strong>New Release</strong> <em>The Gentlemen (2020)</em> &ndash; Hugh Grant in a Guy Ritchie? You gotta be kidding me! Works a dream. Rest of the cast, brilliant. Hugely enjoyable, and quotable&hellip;</p>

<p>Books?</p>

<p><em>Prisoners of Geography (Tim Marshall)</em> &ndash; Borrowed from my godfather back in September or thenabouts, and he wants it back to have a second read. I can see why. Tim has some humour as he whistles through a tour of geopolitics today (well, originally 2015 but updated for Brexit I think, so late 2016 edition). Very convincing, very fun.</p>

<p>New places?</p>

<p>Out on the bike I&rsquo;ve had more of an explore of Queen&rsquo;s Park, Richmond, Camden&hellip; Spotting cafes and restaurants to return to &ndash; Minkies Deli by Kensal Rise station is enticing. No exhibitions or stage shows in 2020 yet, but it&rsquo;s early days.</p>

<p>Online learning</p>

<p>Ripping through UC San Diego&rsquo;s <em>Object Oriented Programming in Java</em> on Coursera: It&rsquo;s a bit simple. Any recommendations for a course on OOP? Have a few chapters left of the Rust book that I&rsquo;ll get around to, and looking forward to starting EPFL&rsquo;s <em>Functional Program Design in Scala</em> that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a while now.</p>

<p>Also need to get on with French! Maybe that should be on the resolutions&rsquo; list?</p>
